At a minimum, you need enough to compile and debug executables using a llvm, vscode, cmake & ninja environment
Other compilation environments are possible, but this is the simpliest and uses the least platform-specific parts

If you haven't set up a windows dev environment like this before; you'll probably need the things listed below

Brief install instructions for windows (using clang & vscode)
* install vscode
* install llvm for windows (I'm using 11.0.0, win64) from https://releases.llvm.org/download.html
* install cmake (I used choco install cmake)
* change vscode settings to point to cmake executable location
* install ninja (I used choco install ninja)
* install windows 10 sdk (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)
* this gets you 99% of the way there... but it turns out you also need Visual Studio 2019 for 2 .lib files: oldnames.lib & msvcrtd.lib. Install from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/. Be aware of the licensing requirements, however
    - (it might be possible to get away with just installing "Build Tools for Visual Studio" here, but I haven't tried that)

Note that Git and ssh can be a hassle for windows. If you don't already have a setup you like, the following
is what I tend to do:
* install chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/install)
* install cmder (choco install cmder)
* this brings with it git (in the folder C:\tools\Cmder\vendor\git-for-windows\bin)
* enable openssh for windows using "Add or remove programs"/"Optional features"/"Add feature" -> add "OpenSSH Client"
* this gives you ssh-keygen, etc. You should use that to generate a key called ~/.ssh/id_rsa
* git doesn't play well with the ssh-agent in Windows' OpenSSH Client
* install, you must run "start-ssh-agent" from within cmder. This is a script within the cmder install, and will start an agent and load that key
* you may want to setup the cmder scripts so that start-ssh-agent is called every time 
* you also need to setup the path to git in settings.json for vscode ("git.path": "C:\\tools\\Cmder\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\bin\\git.exe")


For RenderCore you'll need a little more
* To get the OpenGLES target running, you'll need an implementation of OpenGLES for windows. Use google's project angle: https://github.com/google/angle/blob/master/doc/DevSetup.md
* Google's instructions failed for me the first time -- I had to explicitly set the env variable "vs2019_install" (my VS install is not on drive C:)
* After the first cmake configure, you should get an error message saying GLES could not be found. There's no default location for windows, you must configure it manually
* set the cmake cache variables XLE_OPENGLES_INCLUDE_DIR & XLE_OPENGLES_LIBRARY_DIR
* install java jre (choco install javaruntime)

* install vulkan sdk: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home. You'll also need the "Additional SDK components" (unzip into the same SDK directory, this the debug libs). Debug libs are required to against debug XLE components because of the iterator debugging functionality in the MSVC standard library
