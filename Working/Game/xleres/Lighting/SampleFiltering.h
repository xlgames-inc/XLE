    //  This is AMD's method of shadow filtering (from the D3D11 SDK)
    //  It has been mixed with a similar implementation from nvidia.
    //
    //  It uses a fixed size filter, with weights that change based
    //  on the blocker distance. It seems that the advantage of this over
    //  poisson disk methods is that poisson disk methods can end up
    //  sampling the same pixels multiple times, particularly for small
    //  filter sizes. This method will always sample a fixed box around
    //  the target point. This method might also have slightly smoother
    //  results -- because a poisson disk can introduce artefacts where
    //  the samples in the disk are more or less densely packed.
    //
    //  This method seems to generally sample more points. I wonder if the
    //  regular sampling pattern will improve performance much? Probably
    //  only if one method causes cache misses less frequently.
