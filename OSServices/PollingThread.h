	/** <summary>Abstraction of OS specific event polling behaviour</summary>
	 * 
	 * All OSs provide some means to efficiently wait for, and react to, events raised
	 * by "waitable objects". Typically these waitable objects are related to features
	 * provided by drivers -- such as asynchrous file reads, network socket, etc.
	 * 
	 * Even though all OSs provide roughly the same concepts, the actual API and behaviour
	 * can be quite different. For example, on Windows we have WaitForMultipleObjects and
	 * family. On Linux we have epoll/select/pool. On OSX we have kqueues So we need to use 
	 * some kind of abstraction layer in order to limit the amount of platform specific code.
	 * 
	 * Furthermore, we want to avoid working with the low level concepts (ie, file handle, 
	 * socket handle, event handle, etc) as much as possible and instead prefer robust
	 * patterns. In this case, futures are a great pattern -- they can be used in 3 different
	 * ways, all of which are useful
	 * 
	 * 	- checking the status intermittantly (eg, future.wait_for(0))
	 *  - stalling a thread until the future has a result (eg, future.get()/future.wait())
	 *  - triggering some follow up (eg, when(future, ...))
	 * 
	 * Plus, they represent what we're trying to do in a RAII-friendly way.
	 * 
	 * Internally, the PollingThread will have one or more threads. But we don't want to do 
	 * too much client logic on those threads. It might be better to just shift the client
	 * logic off to a general thread pool somewhere. That may just help avoid any OS
	 * specific complications (given that everything in this implementation is intended 
	 * to be very OS specific)
