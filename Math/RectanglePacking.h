    /// <summary>Sequentially pack rectangles within a fixed area</summary>
    /// When building a texture atlas, we often want to find efficient algorithms
    /// for packing many differently sized textures within one larger texture.
    /// 
    /// We want to find the arrangement of rectangles that leaves the least
    /// unused space left over. We can also (perhaps) rotate the rectangle 90
    /// degrees (if it produces a better packed result).
    ///
    /// There are two variations to this:
    ///     1) when we know all of the rectangles to pack before hand
    ///     2) when we will be sequentially adding rectangles in an 
    ///         undeterminate manner
    ///
    /// If we know all of the rectangles before hand, there are some very accurate
    /// approximations
    ///         see: https://www.jair.org/media/3735/live-3735-6794-jair.pdf
    ///             http://clb.demon.fi/files/RectangleBinPack.pdf
    /// However, many of these methods aren't perfectly suitable for the texture
    /// altas problem we'd like to solve.
    ///
    /// However, we will use a simple & practical method. This method uses a binary
    /// tree so that when every rectangle is placed, we partition the remaining space
    /// into "right" and "down" space.
    ///
    /// See http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/7/bin_packing/ for a good description
    /// of this method.
    ///
    /// The results are reasonably good, but not perfect. When we know all rectangles
    /// before-hand, we want can get good packing by sorting them by max(width, height)
    ///
